2) Preparing a simulation
- edit input file "fd3dp.inp", "fd3dps.inp"
  define number of processors in x-, y- and z-direction (the total number of processors is NPROCX*NPROCY*NPROCZ)
  define number of grid cells in x-, y- and z-direction (NX/NPROCX, NY/NPROCY and NZ/NPROCZ have to be intergers)
  define grid spacings in external file (here: "dx.dat", "dy.dat" and "dz.dat")
      300   0.02
      100   0.04
      600   0.02
    means 300 grid cells with 0.02 m grid spacing followed by 100 grid cells with 0.04 m grid spacing and so on.
    If there are more grid cells than specified in the file the missing ones are filled with the value of the last grid cell.
    If there are less grid cells than specified in the file the remaining ones are ignored.
    Each line in the file has to be followed by a line break!
    To avoid grid dispersion the maximum grid spacing should be on the order of 1/20-1/10 of the minimum wavelength in the model.
  define reference point for coordinate system
    point (x,y,z) defines coordinate of the first grid point in the front upper left corner (REFMOD) for the model grid
  define time stepping (simulation time TIME and time stepping DT)
    The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy-criterion gives an upper limit for DT in order to ensure stability.
    DT < min(DX,DY,DZ)/(max(v)*sqrt(3))  
  define sources
    It is possible to define a reference point (x,y,z) for the source coordinates.
    select source signal (e.g. Ricker or read wavelet from SIGNAL_FILE)
    define source position, frequency, etc. in SOURCE_FILE (e.g. "source_p.dat"), follow the instructions in the source file
  define model
    Models for vP, vS and density can be read from binary or Seismic Unix (SU) files that contain all values as binary float values 
    (z-direction as inner loop, followed by y-direction and x-direction as outer loops) or
    generate model within the source code in the file "model_p.c" / "model_ps.c". Examples are given in the model directory. 
    Layer boundaries can be defined using if-then-else-statements within the loops over the FD grid. "x[i]", y[j] and "z[k]" describe 
    the x-, y- and z-coordinates. Before compilation, this file has to be copied into the /src/-directory.
  define vico-elastic parameters
    L=0 for elastic modeling
    L>0 viscoelastic modeling (see FDVEPS by T. Bohlen, only 1 relaxation mechanism is implemented)
  define boundary conditions
    non-periodic or periodic boundary combined with free surface, PML or absorbing frame
    PMLs show better performance than absorbing frames but can become instable if their parameters are not set correctly
    rule of thumb for SIGMA: SIGMA = (N_SIGMA+1)/2*vP*ln(1/R) with vP ... P-wave velovity and R ... reflection coefficient of PML (R approx. 1e-5 is sufficient)
    KAPPA: KAPPA>=1, KAPPA>1 delays waves reflected at the boundary. If instabilities are observed that originate from the PML boundary, KAPPA should be 
    increased to delay the instability.
  define output of snapshots
    select wavefield components for output
    define dimension and resolution of snapshots
    Remember that the snapshot files can grow considerably with a fine sampling in time and space! 
  define output of seismograms
    read receiver coordinates from REC_FILE (e.g. "receiver_p.dat")
    "receiver_p.dat" / "receiver_ps.dat" contains three columns with receiver coordinates, x ... first column, y ... second column, z ... third column. 
    Each line in the file has to be followed by a line break!
    It is possible to define a reference point (x,y,z) for the receiver coordinates.
    If READREC=0, receiver positions are computed from XREC1, YREC1, ZREC1, XREC2, YREC2, ZREC2, DXREC, DYREC and DZREC. 
    (XREC1,YREC1,ZREC1) and (XREC2,YREC2,ZREC2) define two corners of a rectangle where receivers are placed every XREC / DZREC gridpoints.
    select wavefield components for output
    define sampling rate for seismograms NDT (in multiples of time steps DT)
  define log-file output

3) Compilation
- copy the model file "model_p.c" / "model_ps.c" into the /src/-directory if the model is generated within the source code
- change to the /src/-directory
- edit Makefile if necessary (change compilers, etc.)
- clear old object files *.o (command "make clean")
- compile (command "make fd3dp" / "make fd3dps") 
    We use "mpicc" as compiler. OpenMPI or another version of MPI should be installed. An accordant compiler and compiler flags 
    have to be specified  in the "Makefile".
- If the compilation is successful, an executable file "fd3dp.exe" / "fd3dps.exe" is created in the /bin/-directory.
- change to the /par/-directory

4) Execution of FD3D
- start simulation from the /par/-directory e.g. with 
    "mpirun -np 20 -machinefile nodelist.dat ../bin/fd3dp.exe ./model/fd3dp.inp"
    The number of processors (here 20) must be equal to the number of processors specified in the input file. "nodelist.dat" specifies the nodes with the CPUs to 
    use for the simulation. Depending on the MPI-version, the command to start the simulation might be different. 

The sh-scripts "fd3d_p.job" / "fd3d_ps.job" in the /par/-directory summarize all steps for compilation and execution of the program. 
The examples as they are now consists of a relatively small model with a layer and a halfspace with an inclusion.

- All processors write log-files that might help to identify problems or wrong parameter settings.

5) Display results
- seismograms: "./su/seismergep.sh" and "./su/seismergeps.sh" are sh-scripts to merge the output seismograms of all processors.
- snapshots: ./par/matlab/snap_fd3d_vargrid_model.m is a matlab-script to display the snapshots. It reads all necessary information from the 
    input files and related files.
